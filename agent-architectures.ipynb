Imagine a world where your software is built and managed by a team of intelligent, autonomous agents, each specializing in a different task. This isn't science fiction; it's the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and they're about to change the way you code forever.\n\n**Main Sections:**\n\n**1. Enhanced Modularity and Maintainability: The Power of Specialization**\n    *   **Break Down Complexity:** MAS naturally decomposes large problems into smaller, manageable units (agents) responsible for specific functionalities. This drastically reduces cognitive load and makes debugging a breeze.\n    *   **Independent Evolution:** Each agent can be developed, tested, and updated independently. This agility means faster iteration cycles and easier integration of new features without disrupting the entire system.\n    *   **Clearer Code Structure:** By defining distinct roles and responsibilities for each agent, your codebase becomes inherently more organized and understandable, leading to reduced technical debt.\n\n**2.

Each step must wait for the previous one to finish. What if you have several tasks that are **not dependent** on each other? For example, researching three *different* topics. Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n\n**The Solution: Concurrent Execution**\n\nWhen you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`. This agent executes all of its sub-agents concurrently, dramatically speeding up the workflow. Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n\n**Use Parallel when:** Tasks are independent, speed matters, and you can execute concurrently.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [parallel agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Multi-Topic Research**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"User Request: Research 3 topics\"] -- > B[\"Parallel Execution\"]\n    B -- > C[\"Tech Researcher\"]\n    B -- > D[\"Health Researcher\"]\n    B -- > E[\"Finance Researcher\"]\n\n    C -- > F[\"Aggregator\"]\n    D -- > F\n    E -- > F\n    F -- > G[\"Combined Report\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffffcc\n    style F fill:#ffccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/parallel-agent.png\" alt=\"Parallel Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1 Example: Parallel Multi-Topic Research\n\nLet's build a system with four agents:\n\n1. **Tech Researcher** - Researches AI/ML news and trends\n2. **Health Researcher** - Researches recent medical news and trends\n3. **Finance Researcher** - Researches finance and fintech news and trends\n4. **Aggregator Agent** - Combines all research findings into a single summary","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Tech Researcher: Focuses on AI and ML trends.\ntech_researcher = Agent(\n    name=\"TechResearcher\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Research the latest AI/ML trends.

Unfurling it revealed not nautical charts, but swirling constellations and islands he'd never seen. The ink itself seemed to shift, forming pathways that glowed brighter, then dimmer, as if guided by an unseen tide. A peculiar symbol, like a stylized wave, marked a specific, uncharted spot far offshore. Elias, a man who thought he knew every ripple and current, felt a thrill of the unknown, a call from beyond his solitary
