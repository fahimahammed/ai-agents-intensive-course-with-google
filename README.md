## Course Overview

The **5-Day AI Agents Intensive** is a hands-on program designed to explore the **foundations and practical applications** of AI Agents.  
It covers the key components of modern agent systems — including **models, tools, orchestration, memory, and evaluation** — and shows how to move from prototype LLMs to **production-ready AI systems**.

Each day includes:
- 🧠 Conceptual deep dives  
- 🧩 Hands-on codelabs using Gemini and ADK  
- 💬 Live discussions & livestreams  
- 📑 Whitepapers, podcasts, and guided projects  

By the end of the course, participants will be able to **build, evaluate, and deploy** multi-agent systems that solve real-world problems.
