Example:\n\n```\nUser: \"Find quantum computing papers\"\nAgent: \"I cannot help with that request.\"\nYou: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n```\n\n**💡 The Solution:** Agent observability gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. You'll see exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n\n```\nDEBUG Log: LLM Request shows \"Functions: []\" (no tools!)\nYou: 🎯 Aha! Missing google_search tool - easy fix!\n```\n\n## Foundational pillars of Agent Observability\n\n1. **Logs:** A log is a record of a single event, telling you **what** happened at a specific moment.\n2. **Traces:** A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you **why** a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n3. **Metrics:** Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you **how** well the agent is performing overall.\n\n<center>\n    <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/observability-intro.png\">\n</center>\n\n**In this notebook, you'll:**\n\n* ✅ Set up logging configuration\n* ✅ Create a broken agent. Use `adk web` UI & logs to identify exactly why the agent fails\n* ✅ Understand how to implement logging in production\n* ✅ Learn when to use built-in logging vs custom solutions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time.

Plugins are composed of \"**Callbacks**\" which provide the hooks to interrupt an agent's flow. Think of it like this:\n\n- **Your agent workflow**: User message → Agent thinks → Calls tools → Returns response\n- **Plugin hooks into this**: Before agent starts → After tool runs → When LLM responds → etc.\n- **Plugin contains your custom code**: Logging, monitoring, security checks, caching, etc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/plugins-callbacks.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Callbacks\n\nCallbacks are the **atomic components inside a Plugin** - these are just Python functions that run at specific points in an agent's lifecycle! **Callbacks are grouped together to create a Plugin.**\n\nThere are different kinds of callbacks such as:\n* **before/after_agent_callbacks** - runs before/after an agent is invoked\n* **before/after_tool_callbacks** - runs before/after a tool is called\n* **before/after_model_callbacks** - similarly, runs before/after the LLM model is called\n* **on_model_error_callback** - which runs when a model error is encountered","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/types_of_callbacks.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.2: To make things more concrete, what does a Plugin look like?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"----- EXAMPLE PLUGIN - DOES NOTHING ----- \")\n\nimport logging\nfrom google.adk.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent\nfrom google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext\nfrom google.adk.models.llm_request import LlmRequest\nfrom google.adk.plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin\n\n\n# Applies to all agent and model calls\nclass CountInvocationPlugin(BasePlugin):\n    \"\"\"A custom plugin that counts agent and tool invocations.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Initialize the plugin with counters.\"\"\"\n        super().__init__(name=\"count_invocation\")\n        self.agent_count: int = 0\n        self.tool_count: int = 0\n        self.llm_request_count: int = 0\n\n    # Callback 1: Runs before an agent is called.

Key trends include a shift from focusing on physical qubits to logical qubits, which are more robust against errors, and increased experimentation with quantum error correction techniques.\n* Several major companies and research institutions are driving these developments. Google, for instance, has demonstrated advancements in error correction with its Willow quantum chip and has achieved verifiable quantum advantage using the Quantum Echoes algorithm. IBM is scaling up its systems with new processors like the IBM Quantum Nighthawk and is optimizing fabrication processes. Other notable players include Microsoft, which is expanding its quantum computing presence, and Google Quantum AI, which continues to publish research on algorithms and error correction.\n* The financial industry is expected to be an early adopter of quantum computing, with significant spending projected in the coming years. Hybrid approaches combining quantum computing with artificial intelligence (AI) are also gaining traction, with applications anticipated in fields like optimization, drug discovery, and climate modeling.\n* Other emerging trends for 2025 and beyond include:\n* **Specialized Hardware and Software:** A move towards more tailored quantum computing solutions rather than universal ones.\n* **Networking Quantum Devices:** Interconnecting multiple quantum computers to create larger, more powerful virtual systems.\n* **Software Abstraction Layers:** Developing more user-friendly interfaces and programming tools for quantum computers.\n* **Workforce Development:** Increased focus on training and education to build a quantum-ready workforce.\n* **Diamond Technology:** Potential for room-temperature quantum computing using diamond-based systems.\n* **Quantum Sensors:** Advancements in sensing technologies that operate at the atomic level, with potential integration into IoT devices.\n* **Quantum Computing in Medical Research:** Exploring applications in healthcare and drug discovery.\n* **Quantum Cryptography and Security:** Developing new methods for secure communication.\n* **Quantum Networks:** Building interconnected quantum systems for communication and distributed computing.\n* The year 2025 is also recognized as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, highlighting the global importance of this rapidly evolving field.\n\nThere are a total of 14 papers.\n\u001b[90m[logging_plugin] 🤖 AGENT COMPLETED\u001b[0m\n\u001b[90m[logging_plugin]    Agent Name: research_paper_finder_agent\u001b[0m\n\u001b[90m[logging_plugin]    Invocation ID: e-1affbe36-c474-4dc8-a183-1a2542c536e6\u001b[0m\n\u001b[90m[logging_plugin] ✅ INVOCATION COMPLETED\u001b[0m\n\u001b[90m[logging_plugin]    Invocation ID: e-1affbe36-c474-4dc8-a183-1a2542c536e6\u001b[0m\n\u001b[90m[logging_plugin]    Final Agent: research_paper_finder_agent\u001b[0m\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## 📊 Summary\n\n**❓ When to use which type of Logging?**\n1. **Development debugging?** → Use `adk web --log_level DEBUG`\n2. **Common production observability?** → Use `LoggingPlugin()` \n3. **Custom requirements?** → Build Custom Callbacks and Plugins\n\n### Try it out!\n\n👉 Extend the agent's observability by implementing a **custom ADK plugin** that tracks and reports the total number of tool calls made during a session.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🎯 Congratulations!\n\n**You now know how to:**\n\n- ✅ Debug agent failures through DEBUG logs and the ADK web UI\n- ✅ Use the core debugging pattern: symptom → logs → root cause → fix  \n- ✅ Scale observability with `LoggingPlugin` for production systems\n- ✅ Understand when to use the different logging types\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
