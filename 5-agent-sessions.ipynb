This is a crucial stage because finding the right target is the foundational step for creating any new medicine.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this area:\n\n**The Challenge of Traditional Target Identification:**\n\nHistorically, identifying drug targets has been a laborious and often serendipitous process. It involved:\n\n*   **Deep understanding of disease biology:** Researchers would spend years studying the complex mechanisms of a disease, trying to pinpoint specific molecules or pathways that, when modulated, could alleviate symptoms or cure the condition.\n*   **Hypothesis-driven research:** This often relied on existing knowledge and educated guesses, which could limit the scope of exploration.\n*   **Genomic studies:** While powerful, analyzing vast amounts of genomic data to pinpoint causal genes or pathways for drug development was still a significant challenge.\n*   **\"Druggability\" guesswork:** Even when a potential target was identified, it was difficult to assess whether it was feasible to design a drug that could effectively interact with it.\n\n**How AI is Transforming Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions from massive, complex datasets. Here's how it's being applied:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **Integration of diverse data types:** AI can integrate and analyze data from genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and even patient-reported outcomes, electronic health records, and imaging data.\n    *   **Identifying subtle correlations:** These models can uncover subtle correlations between genetic variations, protein expression levels, metabolic changes, and disease phenotypes that might be missed by human analysis.\n    *   **Uncovering novel pathways:** By sifting through this intricate web of biological information, AI can reveal previously unknown molecular pathways or dysregulated processes that are critical to disease development.\n\n2.  **Network Biology and Systems Biology Approaches:**\n    *   **Mapping biological networks:** AI can help construct and analyze complex biological networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks).\n    *   **Identifying key nodes:** Within these networks, AI can pinpoint critical \"hub\" proteins or genes that play central roles in disease processes. Targeting these hubs can have a more significant therapeutic impact.\n    *   **Understanding disease progression:** By modeling these networks, AI can help understand how disruptions in one part of the system lead to the overall disease state.\n\n3.  **Leveraging Unstructured Data (Text Mining):**\n    *   **Extracting insights from literature:** AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) can scan millions of scientific publications, patents, and clinical trial reports to identify potential new targets and their associations with diseases.\n    *   **Connecting disparate information:** NLP can help connect information that might be spread across different sources and not immediately obvious to a human researcher.\n\n4.  **Predicting \"Druggability\":**\n    *   **Feature engineering:** AI models can be trained on datasets of known druggable and non-druggable targets, learning the molecular features (e.g., shape, surface properties, pocket availability) that make a target amenable to drug binding.\n    *   **Virtual screening of target pockets:** AI can analyze the 3D structure of a target protein to predict if it has suitable pockets or binding sites where a drug molecule could effectively attach. This helps prioritize targets that are more likely to yield successful drug candidates.\n\n5.  **Target Validation through Simulation:**\n    *   **In silico experiments:** AI can simulate the effect of inhibiting or activating a potential target within a biological system, providing early evidence of its therapeutic potential.\n    *   **Predicting off-target effects:** AI can also help predict unintended interactions with other molecules, which could lead to side effects.\n\n**Impact and Significance:**\n\n*   **Broadening the Scope of Discovery:** AI allows researchers to explore a much wider range of potential targets, including those in complex diseases like neurodegenerative disorders or certain types of cancer that have been notoriously difficult to address.\n*   **Reducing the \"Failure Rate\":** By better identifying and validating targets early on, AI can help reduce the high failure rate in drug development, where many drugs fail in clinical trials because the initial target was not optimal.\n*   **Faster Identification:** AI can significantly accelerate the time it takes to identify and validate a promising target, moving projects from concept to the next stage of drug development much more quickly.\n\nThis development is truly foundational. Without a well-chosen and validated target, even the most sophisticated drug design algorithms will struggle. AI is providing the power to see deeper into the biological intricacies of disease, leading to more informed and impactful drug discovery efforts.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the field of AI-driven target identification and validation within drug discovery.

Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.
