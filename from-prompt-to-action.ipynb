Unlike traditional AI, which primarily reacts to commands or follows predefined rules, agentic AI can proactively set goals, plan actions, and execute them in dynamic environments.\n\nAt its core, agentic AI leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a \"brain\" for AI agents, enabling them to perform actions through various tools and APIs. This goes beyond simple content creation; agentic AI executes actions within underlying systems to achieve higher-level objectives. For instance, while generative AI might create marketing materials, agentic AI could deploy them, monitor performance, and automatically adjust the marketing strategy based on the results.\n\nThe science behind agentic AI involves a combination of different AI technologies, including LLMs for reasoning and communication, planning AI for task sequencing, reinforcement learning for optimizing actions, and memory systems for context retention. These systems perceive their environment, reason through tasks, make decisions, execute actions, and learn from their experiences to adapt and improve over time.\n\nAgentic AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries by automating complex processes, optimizing workflows, and enabling proactive decision-making. Examples include AI-powered trading bots that execute trades based on market analysis, autonomous vehicles that navigate using real-time data, and healthcare systems that monitor patient data and adjust treatment recommendations.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":53},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = await runner.run_debug(\"What's the weather in London?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T13:48:11.847413Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T13:48:11.847684Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T13:48:13.945609Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T13:48:11.847656Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T13:48:13.944673Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n ### Continue session: debug_session_id\n\nUser > What's the weather in London?\nhelpful_assistant > The weather in London is currently light rain, with a 100% chance of precipitation.
